# GPS Selective Availability (SA) switch off

This captures the moment SA was switched off at about 2000-05-02T04:05:00Z

I caught this with a Garmin GPS-35 receiver in Dublin on 2 May 2000. The 
switch event and approximate time was announced in advance so I thought it would make an interesting
before and after comparison. I left the receiver run all night while logging
output (in Garmin Binary mode for some extra signal meta-data). I had rendered a quick gnuplot of the 
event back when it happened, and wrote a shot blog post about it 
in 2011.

I thought I had lost this file, but in some pre-Christmas cleaning I came upon
an old CD ROM marked 'GPS stuff'.
